SAY BIO ~Adamanta was found, orphaned, outside of Gullykin where some halflings found her, and took her in as their own. As a youth, Adamanta tried to copy her halfling siblings, and friends by sneaking around and doing other things. However, she was always kind of big, so she ended up helping her siblings, and friends, by lifting them up to windows and such. Now, since she's older, she can sneak around and make her friends and family proud.~
